use RateLimit\RedisRateLimiter;
use Redis;

$rateLimiter = new RedisRateLimiter(new Redis());

$apiKey = 'abc123';

try {
    $rateLimiter->limit($apiKey, Rate::perMinute(100));
    
    //on success
} catch (LimitExceeded $exception) {
   //on limit exceeded
}
```

**Silent rate limiting**

use RateLimit\Rate;
use RateLimit\RedisRateLimiter;
use Redis;

$rateLimiter = new RedisRateLimiter(new Redis());

$ipAddress = '192.168.1.2';
$status = $rateLimiter->limitSilently($ipAddress, Rate::perMinute(100));

echo $status->getRemainingAttempts(); //99
```
